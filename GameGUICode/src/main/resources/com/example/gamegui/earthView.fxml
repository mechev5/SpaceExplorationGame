            <Text text="Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.&#xD;This is enabled by Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water.&#xD;Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's surface.&#xD;The remaining 29.2% of Earth's surface is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses&#xD;within one hemisphere, Earth's land hemisphere.Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by &#xD;vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar&#xD;deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water combined.Earth's land&#xD; is part of Earth's crust, consisting of several slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain&#xD;ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes.&#xD;Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive &#xD;solar winds and cosmic radiation.">
