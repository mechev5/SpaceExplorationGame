Here's where I'm going to keep the notes on things that need to be done, could be done, values associated with the ships, the players, maybe even the galaxies that these players inhabit. There also seems to be the player's base, which I still don't know a lot of information about but for now, let's just get some ideas out on what things to be stored inside these classes.
